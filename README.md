This github repo is provided for use by Dr. Jean Anne Incorvia's INCLAB group in the University of Texas at Austin's ECE department.

Unfinished 2D APFET Mosfet device simulations for Comsol are included in this github repo. 
Please read the guide to see the resources I used, sources of error I ran into, and next steps. 

My most up-to-date .mph BP simulation file could not be uploaded due to file size, so email me at enrique.antunano@gmail.com so I can share my up-to-date BP simulation files.
